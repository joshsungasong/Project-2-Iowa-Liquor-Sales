# Content of this repository

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook containing code that I ran in order to conduct the necessary data analysis for this project. (insert link to the Jupyter notebook)

# Description of the data set

The dataset consists of Iowa liquor data from 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. Each observation represents a liquor order and lists its location data (i.e. zip code, county name, city), numerical descriptions such as the sale of the order and the number of bottles sold.

# Key findings from the project
What I found out was that the 2015 predicted total sales and the 2015 actual total sales were pretty much equal. The model predicted sales was projected to be $292 million for the year for 2016 compared with $284 million for 2015. This model does not include other factors such as economic conditions, demographics, population data, how consumers respond to price changes, etc. This model assumes a relatively static economy, population dynamics, and steady prices. 

# Explanation of my regression model 

My regression model uses variables of the data to project total sales. Before projecting 2016 total sales, I want to create a model using 2015 Iowa Liquor data, create some models, test them, and pick one that performs the best. The variables I used include the number of bottles sold in quarter one of 2015, total volume sold in quarter one of 2015, and quarter one sales. I created models to test the predictability of these variables. From this model, I used it to project 2016 total sales, which is the desired result of the project.

# List of concepts and skills utilized for this project

I used a variety of concepts and skills for this project and they are listed below:
- Regression analysis
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data munging/cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Cross validation & test/train split
- Presenting and visualizing data using Python (i.e. Matplotlib)
- Model building in order to project total sales for Iowa Liqour
